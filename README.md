## Project 0 for Project Nautilus ##

###Instructions:
This project is for the Front End class on Udacity. It is a simple site to brush up on the very basics of HTML and CSS.

1. Add your name where it says [Your name]. Refresh to see it! Answer the other questions in the HTML by changing and saving the text in the file. Watch what happens when you refresh the page!
2. Notice how the site is boring and isn't styled? That's because there's no CSS, which controls the style of the page. Go to the forums to get instructions for creating a <link> to the CSS in the file styles.css.
3. Looks better, but now see how the profile picture is just too big for the page? There's a bug in your CSS. Contact your mentor to get some help!
4. Now that you have the styles for the page, customize some colors! Go into styles.css and change the color of the colored bar in the middle of the screen.
